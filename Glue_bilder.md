- Glue is in use since the stone age (Pitch glue)
- Glues have 2 properties:
  1.	They have to stick to the surface and remain on it
     - Sticking:
     --	mechanical interlocking of surface imperfections
     --	intermolecular forces of attraction
     --	chemical reaction

  2.	The glue has to set (harden)
     - Setting :
     --	cooling
     --	evaporation of or solvent
     --	chemical reaction

- brand - Evostick

- good for wood, wood to metal
- takes a short time to set (10-20 minutes)
- sets with moisture (air contact)
- can be messy
- only way to get of hands: rubbing it away
- parts that are glued, have to be claimed, as the glues foam up
- not good for gap filling, since the foam glue is very weak

### Sikaflex Polyurethane glue

- used for materials that don't conduct heat
- sets fast (around a minute)
- normal glue sticks can have bad quality and not be very sticky
-- industrial glue sticks are better

### Contact glue
![](https://www.werkstatt-store.de/images/product_images/original_images/Kleber_contact_1.jpg)
- good for wood
- solvent based or water based
- has to be applied on both surfaces
-- wait some time before putting together (30 minutes)
-- instant glues together on contact, careful
- sets by pressure (after gluing parts together apply pressure)
- does not dry well, if cold

### Epoxy glues
